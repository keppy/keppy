### Welcome Travler üçª

I'm currently working on WorldEnder.ai; an interactive RAG system about the apocalypse. Through this project we will learn just how far we can push RAG in a fun (read: slightly concerning) direction! 

I publish my findings at [keppylab.com](https://www.keppylab.com)

Smooth sailing ‚õµ
