### Welcome ðŸ‘¾

I'm currently working on WorldEnder.ai; a text-adventure about extinction events with a RAG backend. Through this project we will learn just how far we can push RAG in a fun (read: slightly concerning) direction!

I publish my findings at [keppylab.com](https://www.keppylab.com)

Smooth sailing â›µ
